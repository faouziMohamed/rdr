### Any way, how to do ?
An example of a [pseudo] shortned link will look like this : https://faouzimohamed.github.io/rdr/1 (should link to this repo).
1. To add a new short link, add an issue with the title being the link you want to shorten (including the http(s)://) to https://github.com/faouziMohamed/rdr/issues.
1. The newly created short url can be accessed via faouzimohamed.github.io/rdr/{issue_number} (issue number without the leading '#')
